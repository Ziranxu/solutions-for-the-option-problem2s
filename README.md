1  An American put option to sell the Swiss franc for dollars has a strike of $0.95, a time to maturity of six months, and volatility of 
the franc of 10%. The dollar interest rate is 6% and the Swiss franc interest rate is 4%, while the current exchange rate is 0.85.
(a) Use a 12 step binomial tree (using the standard CRR assumptions) to value the option.
(b) Estimate ∆, Γ, and Θ.
(c) Estimate ν.
(d) Use a 12 step binomial tree and the ad hoc tree model above to valuethe option.

2   Price a six month American call option struck at $30 on a stock whose price is currently $28 which is expected to pay dividends of 
$1 on the second and fifth month. Assume a volatility of 15% annualized, use twelve time steps, and follow the methodology wherein stock 
prices are assumed to have two components: a part uncertain and a part that is the present value of dividends paid during the life of the
option.
Price the same option, but include another dividend payment at seven months and include this dividend in your present value determination.

(a) Plot the implied distribution using uniform distance in strike of 0.01 by using a quadratic interpolation.
(b) What is the implied probability that the price will be between 147.08 and 294.16?
(c) What is the probability that the price will be below 147.08?
